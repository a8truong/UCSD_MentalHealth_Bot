# UCSD MentalHealth Bot

This is a mental health chatbot targeted at UCSD students, primarily to inform students of resources available to them as well as provide a nonjudgemental space for them to reach out for help. 

To run the code, conda create --n envName python = 3.10, and then pip install -r requirements.txt and create a .env file in the project folder and set environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY = Your own OpenAI API key.

With the conda environment activated, cd scripts and run streamlit run app.py. This will open up the chatbot application locally and allow you to talk with it.
